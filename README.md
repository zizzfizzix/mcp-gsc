## Getting Started (No Coding Experience Required!)

### 1. Set Up Google Search Console API Access

Before using this tool, you'll need to create API credentials that allow Claude to access your GSC data:

1. Create a Google Cloud account if you don't have one and access the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Set up a service account (like a special user for API access)
3. Download the credentials file (a JSON file)
4. Grant this service account access to your GSC properties

  </a>
</div>

*Click the image above to watch the step-by-step video tutorial*

### 2. Install Required Software

You'll need to install these tools on your computer:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.11 or newer) - This runs the connection between GSC and Claude
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - Required for running the MCP inspector and certain MCP components
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) - The AI assistant you'll chat with

Make sure both Python and Node.js are properly installed and available in your system path before proceeding.

### 3. Download the Google Search Console MCP 

You need to download this tool to your computer. The easiest way is:

1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip the downloaded file to a location you can easily find (like your Documents folder)

Alternatively, if you're familiar with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AminForou/mcp-gsc.git
```

### 4. Install Required Components

Open your computer's Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows):

1. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the files:
   ```bash
   # Example (replace with your actual path):
   cd ~/Documents/mcp-gsc-main
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (this keeps the project dependencies isolated):
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended):
   uv venv .venv
   
   # If uv is not installed, install it first:
   pip install uv
   # Then create the virtual environment:
   uv venv .venv

   # OR using standard Python:
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

   **Note:** If you get a "pip not found" error when trying to install uv, see the "If you get 'pip not found' error" section below.

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using uv:
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt

   # OR using standard pip:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # If you encounter any issues with the MCP package, install it separately:
   pip install mcp
   ```

   **If you get "pip not found" error:**
   ```bash
   # First ensure pip is installed and updated:
   python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   
   # Then try installing the requirements again:
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Or to install uv:
   python3 -m pip install uv
   ```

When you see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt, it means the virtual environment is active and the dependencies will be installed there without affecting your system Python installation.

### 5. Connect Claude to Google Search Console

1. Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) if you haven't already
2. Make sure you have your Google service account credentials file saved somewhere on your computer
3. Open your computer's Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:

```bash
   # For Mac users:
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   
   # For Windows users:
   notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

4. Add the following text (this tells Claude how to connect to GSC):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gscServer": {
         "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/-main/.venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/mcp-gsc-main/gsc_server.py"],
         "env": {
           "GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH": "/FULL/PATH/TO/service_account_credentials.json"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important:** Replace all paths with the actual locations on your computer:
   
   - The first path should point to the Python executable inside your virtual environment
   - The second path should point to the `gsc_server.py` file inside the folder you unzipped
   - The third path should point to your Google service account credentials JSON file
   
   Examples:
   - Mac: 
     - Python path: `/Users/yourname/Documents/mcp-gsc/.venv/bin/python`
     - Script path: `/Users/yourname/Documents/mcp-gsc/gsc_server.py`
   - Windows: 
     - Python path: `C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\mcp-gsc\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe`
     - Script path: `C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\mcp-gsc\\gsc_server.py`

5. Save the file:
   - Mac: Press Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X to exit
   - Windows: Click File > Save, then close Notepad

6. Restart Claude Desktop
7. When Claude opens, you should now see GSC tools available in the tools section

### 6. Start Analyzing Your SEO Data!

Now you can ask Claude questions about your GSC data! Claude can not only retrieve the data but also analyze it, explain trends, and create visualizations to help you understand your SEO performance better.

Here are some powerful prompts you can use with each tool:

| **Tool Name**                   | **Sample Prompt**                                                                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `list_properties`               | "List all my GSC properties and tell me which ones have the most pages indexed."                 |
| `get_site_details`              | "Analyze the verification status of mywebsite.com and explain what the ownership details mean."  |
| `add_site`                      | "Add my new website https://mywebsite.com to Search Console and verify its status."              |
| `delete_site`                   | "Remove the old test site https://test.mywebsite.com from Search Console."                       |
| `get_search_analytics`          | "Show me the top 20 search queries for mywebsite.com in the last 30 days, highlight any with CTR below 2%, and suggest title improvements." |
| `get_performance_overview`      | "Create a visual performance overview of mywebsite.com for the last 28 days, identify any unusual drops or spikes, and explain possible causes." |
| `check_indexing_issues`         | "Check these important pages for indexing issues and prioritize which ones need immediate attention: mywebsite.com/product, mywebsite.com/services, mywebsite.com/about" |
| `inspect_url_enhanced`          | "Do a comprehensive inspection of mywebsite.com/landing-page and give me actionable recommendations to improve its indexing status." |
| `batch_url_inspection`          | "Inspect my top 5 product pages, identify common crawling or indexing patterns, and suggest technical SEO improvements." |
| `get_sitemaps`                  | "List all sitemaps for mywebsite.com, identify any with errors, and recommend next steps." |
| `list_sitemaps_enhanced`        | "Analyze all my sitemaps for mywebsite.com, focusing on error patterns, and create a prioritized action plan." |
| `submit_sitemap`                | "Submit my new product sitemap at https://mywebsite.com/product-sitemap.xml and explain how long it typically takes for Google to process it." |
| `get_sitemap_details`           | "Check the status of my main sitemap at mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml and explain what the warnings mean for my SEO." |
| `get_search_by_page_query`      | "What search terms are driving traffic to my blog post at mywebsite.com/blog/post-title? Identify opportunities to optimize for related keywords." |
| `compare_search_periods`        | "Compare my site's performance between January and February. What queries improved the most, which declined, and what might explain these changes?" |
| `get_advanced_search_analytics` | "Analyze my mobile search performance for queries with high impressions but positions below 10, and suggest content improvements to help them rank better." |

You can also ask Claude to combine multiple tools and analyze the results. For example:

- "Find my top 20 landing pages by traffic, check their indexing status, and create a report highlighting any pages with both high traffic and indexing issues."

- "Analyze my site's performance trend over the last 90 days, identify my fastest-growing queries, and check if the corresponding landing pages have any technical issues."

- "Compare my desktop vs. mobile search performance, visualize the differences with charts, and recommend specific pages that need mobile optimization based on performance gaps."

- "Identify queries where I'm ranking on page 2 (positions 11-20) that have high impressions but low CTR, then inspect the corresponding URLs and suggest title and meta description improvements."

Claude will use the GSC tools to fetch the data, present it in an easy-to-understand format, create visualizations when helpful, and provide actionable insights based on the results.

## Data Visualization Capabilities

Claude can help you visualize your GSC data in various ways:

- **Trend Charts**: See how metrics change over time
- **Comparison Graphs**: Compare different time periods or dimensions
- **Performance Distributions**: Understand how your content performs across positions
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between different metrics
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize complex datasets with color-coded representations

Simply ask Claude to "visualize" or "create a chart" when analyzing your data, and it will generate appropriate visualizations to help you understand the information better.

## Troubleshooting

### Python Command Not Found

On macOS, the default Python command is often `python3` rather than `python`, which can cause issues with some applications including Node.js integrations.

If you encounter errors related to Python not being found, you can create an alias:

1. Create a Python alias (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # For macOS users:
   sudo ln -s $(which python3) /usr/local/bin/python
   
   # If that doesn't work, try finding your Python installation:
   sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
   ```

2. Verify the alias works:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

This creates a symbolic link so that when applications call `python`, they'll actually use your `python3` installation.

### Claude Configuration Issues

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. Make sure all file paths in your configuration are correct and use the full path
2. Check that your service account has access to your GSC properties
3. Restart Claude Desktop after making any changes
4. Look for error messages in Claude's response when you try to use a tool
5. Ensure your virtual environment is activated when running the server manually

### Other Unexpected Issues

If you encounter any other unexpected issues during installation or usage:

1. Copy the exact error message you're receiving
2. Use ChatGPT or Claude and explain your problem in detail, including:
   - What you were trying to do
   - The exact error message
   - Your operating system
   - Any steps you've already tried
3. AI assistants can often help diagnose and resolve technical issues by suggesting specific solutions for your situation

Remember that most issues have been encountered by others before, and there's usually a straightforward solution available.
